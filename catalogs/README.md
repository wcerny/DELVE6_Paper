## Contents:

Nine .fits files adapted from DELVE DR2, each corresponding to a different HEALPix pixel at resolution nside = 32. Specifically, these include the pixel that includes DELVE 6 and its eight neighboring pixels.

Note that these files have only a very limited selections of columnsl, namely those needed for generating the manuscript figures.
Users interested in the dataset with all columns included are encouraged to directly access the data through NOIRLab's Astro Data Lab (https://datalab.noirlab.edu/delve/)


## Column Schema: 

QUICK_OBJECT_ID = Internal DELVE ID for a given source

RA  = Right Ascension (in degrees)

DEC = Declination (in degrees)

WAVG_EXT_CORRECTED_G = Extinction-corrected, g-band PSF magnitude, from a conditions-weighted average across exposures (in mag)

WAVG_EXT_CORRECTED_R = Extinction-corrected, r-band PSF magnitude, from a conditions-weighted average across exposures (in mag)
