## Overview of Contents: 

1. /result_files/: Probabilistic membership catalog and MCMC chains from $\texttt{ugali}$
3. /code/: Codes used to extract quantitative results from MCMC chain and generate figures 
4. /figures/: files for the figures in the manuscript (.pdf or .png format)
5. /catalogs/: Selected catalog data from DELVE DR2 used for characterization analysis
6. /raw_all/: Miscellaneous files from $\texttt{ugali}$ and $\texttt{simple}$; most users can ignore


## Dependencies and Other Software: 
The results from this work are primarily based on results derived from the use of two open-source software packages: $\texttt{simple}$ and $\texttt{ugali}$. Here, we generally provide only the outputs of these software packages, and refer the reader to these packages' respective repositories for information on their use.

Other dependencies of the code repository include, but are not limited to: $\texttt{astropy}$, $\texttt{numpy}$, $\texttt{scipy}$, $\texttt{ChainConsumer}$
